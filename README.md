# RayTracer

This project was written and assembled for my learning purposes, as well as for building my portfolio.

In fact, this program colors pixels on a 1024x768 plane in different colors. By using the PPM file format and RGB encoding, we can define the positions of spheres, light sources, and planes in space. We can assign them colors, sizes, and behaviors. The program calculates the color of each pixel based on the light source, object color, transparency, or reflectivity and outputs it to a PPM file.

The key elements here are the Phong formula, the Shell law, and various interactions between vectors.

I would like to express my enormous gratitude ssloy(https://github.com/ssloy) for his repository and for providing links to related materials.
